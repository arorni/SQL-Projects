What is a Unicorn??
A startup that has reached 1 billion in valuation and is still not public. 

Objective:
The goal of this project is to help an investment firm strategize it's investment decisions by finding the most promising industries to invest in. 

Analysis:
How do we define the most promising industry? There can be # of ways to do that:
1) Industries with companies that provide stable stock price growth and earning reports.
2) Industries attracting significant venture capital investments.
3) Industries with a growing number of Unicorns each year.

I have used the third method to accomplish the objective. I have completed this "Unicorn company analysis" project on the Datacamp website. 

Question 1: Finding the top three industries
To find the most promising industry, at first, I tried to get the top three industries in terms of # of unicorns added and their average valuation (in billions) for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. It gives an idea about the trend in the top three industries 
for the past three years. 

Outcome:
From this analysis, I have found that "Fintech", "Internet software & services", and "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer" were
the top three industries, switching places with one another, in the past three years with their average valuation in the range of 
approxiately 2-7 billion dollars.

Question 2: Apart from the top three, what are the other probable industries that could be considered for further investment?

I have gotten the list of top three industries, but what if an investment firm thinks that the top three industries are already getting saturated?? What if there are some political/market changes that happened this year
and these three top industries are not expected to stay at the top in future? What if the firm simply would like to consider other probable industries for investment? Or what if they're just curious to look at how far other contenders are from the top three industries. 
So, I decided to give the list of top ten industries. 

Using the second query in the notebook, I found out the list of top ten industries in terms of total # of Unicorn companies added in the past three years. The following industries are in the list:
1. Fintech
2. Internet software & services
3. E-commerce & direct-to-consumer
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Health
6. Other
7. Cybersecurity
8. Supply chain, logistics, & delivery
9. Data management & analytics
10. Mobile & telecommunications

Recommendations: Based on the data, the top three industries in the past three years (2019,2020, 2021) are "Fintech", "Internet software & services", and "E-commerce & direct-to-consumer". The investment firm can consider analyzing these industries to 
find companies to invest in. If it wants to invest in more than three industries or wants to look at other probable options to diversify it's portfolio, it can refer to the top ten industries list.
